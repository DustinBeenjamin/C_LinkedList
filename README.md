# C_LinkedList
I have a bad habit of not using version control. Consequently, I had no recent work to show when it came for looking for an internship. This was an extracurriculear project meant to challenge myself and show potential employers my work. 

## Consequently, the purpose of the program is a bit vauge. This is evident by the provided methods of linkedList.c, and the simplicity of the node. Im trying to make it as general purpose as possible, so im slowly adding functionality.
Things I want to implement:
-> The ability to swap any two elements
-> A method that will sort the list, but the user provides their own sort method with a function pointer
-> A property of the linked list that holds a function pointer for a comparison. That way, once the list has been sorted, adding a new element will add it to the sorted position, instead of the end.
-> The ability to change the way the list is sorted, and consequently the way it sorts itself when Add() is called.
-> I dont know if its possible, but a way to use custom nodes. Im sure it is...
